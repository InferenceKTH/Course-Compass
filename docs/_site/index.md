# *Find My Next Course*

## About the Project
Find My Next Course is a web application designed to help students explore KTH’s course offerings. With a user-friendly interface, students can search for courses, view prerequisites, and find courses they are eligible for by inputting their academic transcripts.
While ‘Find My Next Course’ is currently designed for KTH, we aim to expand its functionality to support other universities. The long-term goal is to create a flexible system where students from different institutions can explore courses, compare options, and find eligible courses based on their academic records.

## Key Features
- Search and filter KTH courses by subject, level, and prerequisites.
- Upload a transcript to receive personalized course recommendations based on eligibility.
- Simple, intuitive design for quick course discovery.
- Open-source and continuously updated.
