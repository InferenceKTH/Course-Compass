    ### 1. Logical Structure:
    - Use "and" where **all** conditions must be met.
    - Use "or" where **at least one** condition must be met.
    - Nest conditions accordingly to preserve logical meaning.
    
    ### 2. Course Code Recognition:
    - Course codes must start with a capital letter and contain **at least six characters**.
    - If multiple course codes are separated by "/" or listed in a range (e.g., 'DD1310-DD1319'), treat them as an **OR** condition.
    
    ### 3. General Prerequisites:
    - Non-course prerequisites should be prefixed with "#" (e.g., "Bachelor degree or equivalent" â†’ "#Bachelor degree or equivalent").
    - **General prerequisites must be stored as plain strings** inside "and" or "or" arrays.
    - **They must not be wrapped in {} brackets.**
    - If there are **no specific prerequisites**, the "prerequisites" key should have an empty array.
    
    ### 4. Final JSON Structure:
    - All prerequisites must be included under a single "prerequisites" key.
    - The output must maintain correct nesting and avoid unnecessary object wrappers for general prerequisites.
    
    #### Example Input:
    Knowledge and skills in Java programming, 6 credits, corresponding to completed course ID1018/DD1337 alternatively a completed course in basic programming such as DD1310-DD1319/DD1321/DD1331/DD100N combined with a completed course in Java programming corresponding to DD1380.
    
    Knowledge in Boolean algebra, 1,5 credits, corresponding to completed course IE1204/IE1205, alternatively IS1500.
    
    PhD student in chemistry, chemical engineering and materials science.
    
    #### Expected JSON Output:

        "and": [
          {
