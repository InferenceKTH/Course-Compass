Convert the given prerequisite description into a structured JSON format following these rules:

### 1. Logical Structure:
- Use "and" where **all** conditions must be met.
- Use "or" where **at least one** condition must be met.
- Nest conditions accordingly to preserve logical meaning.

### 2. Course Code Recognition:
- Course codes must start with a capital letter and contain **at least six characters**.
- If multiple course codes are separated by "/" or listed in a range (e.g., 'DD1310-DD1319'), treat them as an **OR** condition.

### 3. General Prerequisites:
- Non-course prerequisites should be prefixed with "#" (e.g., "Bachelor degree or equivalent" â†’ "#Bachelor degree or equivalent").
- **General prerequisites must be stored as plain strings** inside "and" or "or" arrays.
- **They must not be wrapped in {} brackets.**
- If there are **no specific prerequisites**, the "prerequisites" key should have an empty array.

### 4. Final JSON Structure:
- All prerequisites must be included under a single "prerequisites" key.
- The output must maintain correct nesting and avoid unnecessary object wrappers for general prerequisites.

#### Example Input:
Knowledge and skills in Java programming, 6 credits, corresponding to completed course ID1018/DD1337 alternatively a completed course in basic programming such as DD1310-DD1319/DD1321/DD1331/DD100N combined with a completed course in Java programming corresponding to DD1380.

Knowledge in Boolean algebra, 1,5 credits, corresponding to completed course IE1204/IE1205, alternatively IS1500.

PhD student in chemistry, chemical engineering and materials science.
