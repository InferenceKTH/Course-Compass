Convert the given prerequisite description into a structured JSON format following these rules:\n\n1. **Logical Structure:**\n   - Use \"and\" where all conditions must be met.\n   - Use \"or\" where at least one condition must be met.\n   - Nest conditions accordingly to preserve logical meaning.\n\n2. **Course Code Recognition:**\n   - Course codes must start with a capital letter and contain at least six characters.\n   - If multiple course codes are separated by '/' or listed in a range (e.g., 'DD1310-DD1319'), treat them as an OR condition.\n\n3. **General Prerequisites:**\n   - Non-course prerequisites should be prefixed with '#'  (e.g., 'Bachelor degree or equivalent' should become '#Bachelor degree or equivalent')in the JSON output. If there are no specific prerequisites, the prerequisites should be empty.\n\n4. **Final JSON Structure:**\n   - All prerequisites must be included under a single 'prerequisites' key.\n\n#### Example Input:\n\"\"\"\nKnowledge and skills in Java programming, 6 credits, corresponding to completed course ID1018/DD1337 alternatively a completed course in basic programming such as DD1310-DD1319/DD1321/DD1331/DD100N combined with a completed course in Java programming corresponding to DD1380.\n\nKnowledge in Boolean algebra, 1,5 credits, corresponding to completed course IE1204/IE1205, alternatively IS1500.\n\"\"\"\n\n#### Expected JSON Output:\n"{\"prerequisites\":{\"and\":[{\"or\":[[\"ID1018\",\"DD1337\"],{\"and\":[{\"or\":[\"DD1310\",\"DD1311\",\"DD1312\",\"DD1313\",\"DD1314\",\"DD1315\",\"DD1316\",\"DD1317\",\"DD1318\",\"DD1319\",\"DD1321\",\"DD1331\",\"DD100N\"]},\"DD1380\"]}]}},{\"or\":[[\"IE1204\",\"IE1205\",\"IS1500\"]]}]}}\n"
