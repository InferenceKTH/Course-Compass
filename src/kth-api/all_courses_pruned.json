Once the easily accessible resources of U-235 become exhausted, a transition to reactors capable of breeding their own fissile fuel from U-238 may become economically feasible. Breeder reactors of \"Generation IV\"-design, would besides plutonium, also recycle minor actinides, in order to reduce the long-term radio-toxic inventory sent to geological repositories. Another Generation IV-objective is the operation at high temperature, leading to better conversion efficiency, thus compensating for the higher maintenance and fuel costs of these systems. After this course, you will be able to make design choices that makes Generation IV reactors sustainable, safe and reasonably economical. This objective is achieved if you show that you are able to</p><ul><li>Calculate and analyse reactor safety parameters in fast neutron reactors.</li><li>Assess breeding performance for potential fuels and coolants</li><li>Select structural materials that permit high burnup in fast neutron spectra.</li></ul><p>An intrinsic objective of the course is to achieve skills necessary for working as a scientist or engineer. The main assignment is therefore formulated as a project/research task, which will be presented in the form of a conference paper.The objective is accomplished if you show that you are able to</p><ul><li>identify missing pieces of information necessary to complete the research task and independently find this information from external sources.</li><li>assess and use contents of references,</li><li>communicate with your colleagues and your teacher about progress and problems arising during research,</li><li>orally as well as in writing present the outcome of your results in a scientific and pedagogic manner.</li></ul><p>Passing the course typically means that you have attended 20 hours of meetings, and performed 140 hours of work in your office.

In the era of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) in which physical devices such as sensors and RFID tags are integrated with electronics to provide capabilities of sensing, computing and communication, assuring security of such systems becomes a great challenge. In order to tackle this problem, industry is making efforts across multiple layers involving cryptographic algorithms, protocols, secure integrated circuits, hardware architecture, etc. From the academic side, we have the responsibility to educate and prepare our students - the future engineers, for the security challenges of the IoT era. Specifically, in this course, we aim to make the students aware of potential hardware vulnerabilities and to give them the necessary knowledge and skills required for building trustworthy hardware.</p><p>Upon completion, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Describe state-of-the-art hardware security techniques. Justify their targeted applications and limitations. Describe how security is assured in an exemplary application.</li><li>Describe the threats to a system from the hardware perspective as well as available countermeasures. Apply the knowledge to select a suitable set of countermeasures for a specific threat scenario.</li><li>Analyze and critically assess trade-offs between system performance, cost, and security. Exemplify some of the trade-offs that are available to designers of electronic and embedded systems.</li><li>Explain the need for hardware security primitives.

Therefore, the course investigates several topics, including active mobility, city logistics, public transport, and rail transport</p><p>The focus of the course is on new concepts and methodologies emerging from academia, the industry, and the public sector. In particular, the nexus between research and practice is analysed by looking at how academic researchers and transport practitioners tackle different real-world transport problems. Each section is centred around one theme and involves the participation of experts from the industry and public sector. The academic researchers present different methodologies and necessary theoretical background to understand and tackle the transport problems presented in each thematic area. The guest lecturers show how different relevant issues are addressed in real-world practice.</p><p>The course will take a problem-oriented approach where pertinent methodologies will be highlighted along with reflections, critical discussions and engagement from practice and policy.</p><p>For the assessment of the course, the participants will prepare an elevator pitch at the beginning of the course and a reflection essay at the end. Active engagement during seminars and workshop sessions would also be expected. In the elevator pitch they present their research and for the essay the students are to write a reflection about how the course relates to their individual research topic based on the different perspectives that are discussed.</p><p>To use the opportunity that doctoral candidates of different domain interact with each other as well as with researchers from academia and representatives from industry and authorities, half a day is reserved for a networking event.</p>",

The ultimate scope of the course is for students to acquire the ability to develop new and imaginative ways of conceptualizing nature/society relationships in different geo-political and cultural contexts, in order to contribute to the formulation of more inclusive and socially just environmental policies. The course will familiarize students with the key concepts and tools used by political ecologists and help students conduct political ecological research.</p>",

With the ongoing development of new reactor types, unorthodox fuel materials, non-aqueous coolants and higher operating temperatures, it will be necessary to have proper understanding of the principles and mechanisms governing the changes in and reactions between materials under extreme conditions and in untested combinations. This course aims to bridge the gap between basic university-level chemistry and advanced treatises on some particular aspect of nuclear fuel chemistry.</p><p>On completion of the course, students should be able to estimate solubilities and migration of materials in ceramic and metallic fuels, evaluate their thermo-chemical properties, identify realistic production methods for advanced fuels, predict chemical reactions between different materials in the reactor core, select suitable combinations of fuel, cladding and coolant for use in novel reactor types, distinguish between several important forms of corrosion and evaluate the potential for their appearance, perform simple calculations of mechanical and thermal stress in fuel rods and the associated limits of reactor operation, identify the major safety issues that emerge with increasing burn-up, and calculate yields and purities in refining and reprocessing.</p>",

This course focuses on the modelling aspects of FEM with the emphasis on structural mechanics problems. Non-trivial loading will be considered in the sense that the loading itself may depend on the solution of other problems of physics. For instance, if the deformation in a solid depends on heat flow, a heat conduction problem must be solved, or if it depends on the normal and shear tractions caused by a flowing fluid, a fluid mechanics problem must be solved. Solving these may be done in a separate step or in a manner fully coupled to the structural mechanics problem. These kinds of problems are often referred to as multiphysics problems. The course aims at expanding and improving the participants&#8217; abilities and skills in technical modelling of complex engineering multiphysics problems by use of FEM.</p><p>After the course, the participants should be able to:</p><ul><li>Identify the physical phenomena that need to be considered in order to solve a specific engineering problem.</li><li>Formulate an appropriate discretized geometrical model that can be solved by FEM.</li><li>Choose a material model, or models, that capture the key features in the application.&#160;</li><li>Formulate relevant initial and boundary conditions, respectively, for a given multiphyics problem.</li><li>Correctly analyse the outcome of the FEM simulation.</li><li>Describe and present the engineering problem that has been analysed, its mathematical formulation, the FEM model used to solve the problem and the results in a well-structured technical report.</li></ul>",

The course also considers current research topics in data mining with a focus on mining of very large amounts of data.<br />After this course, students will be able to mine different types of data, e.g., high-dimensional data, graph data, and infinite/never-ending data (data streams); as well as to program and build data-mining applications. They are also expected to know how to solve problems in real-world applications, e.g., recommender systems, association rules, link analysis, and duplicate detection. They will master various mathemathical techniques, e.g., linear algebra, optimization, and dynamic programming. Moreover, students should be able to describe and apply current research trends in data mining (including methods, algorithms, language support and tools).</p>",

The course will also give insight in different media of investigation and presentation, hereby training and improving the use and understanding of a set of tools used in the design process, and in the process of translation between ideas, analyses, proposals, and projects. Seen through these different textures, the course will introduce participants into the social, cultural and political implications of urban transformation as well as provide training in analysing, describing and responding architecturally to urban spaces as a materialized textures.</p><p>After the course, the student will be able to:</p><p>-Theoretically, critically, and conceptually contextualize different tools of analysis,</p><p>design, and representation, including their limitations and potentials in situated</p><p>design work</p><p>-Work with different tools and concepts to concretely advance their understanding of an</p><p>urban context</p><p>-Work with, refine, and develop representational techniques that respond to</p><p>investigated challenges as well as design intents</p><p>-Use representational techniques, analytic tools and design methods to explore a</p><p>situation to identify sustainability challenges</p><p>-Develop explorative proposals that focus on responding to identified challenges rather</p><p>than general urban design goals</p><p>-Critically reflect on and constructively develop relations between theory and design</p><p>work</p><p>-Situate specific current theory and practice in a wider context, including overall</p><p>introductory understanding of historical development of theory and research, and the</p><p>roles of gender theory and feminist studies</p><p>-Present and communicate project work in line with the above in visualized, oral, and</p><p>written forms</p>",

The course will train participants as well in analysing, visualizing, and responding architecturally to urban and rural spaces as physical, cultural, political and social entities. Central to the course&#8217;s learning is problem formulation, and after the course students will be equipped with knowledge and skills concerning how to formulate sustainability problems in such a way that they can be investigated and developed through design work.</p><p>Upon completion of the course, participants should be able to:</p><p>&#8226; formulate sustainable urban design problems in such a way that they (a) relate to wider sustainability and societal challenges in a productive way and (b) can be investigated and addressed through design proposals</p><p>&#8226; analyse a given spatial situation in relation to its cultural, socio-economic, political, and historic context taking into account issues of intersectionality (race, gender, class, power relations);</p><p>&#8226; visually and verbally demonstrate the connection and impact of different scales on urban design from micro to macro politics in respect to local, regional, national and global levels;</p><p>&#8226; develop a conceptual framework for design projects and to develop the project within this framework;</p><p>&#8226; identify and critically revisit the impact of concepts, methods, and outcomes of urban designs on everyday life, and reflect on the professions ethics and responsibility;</p><p>&#8226; represent and communicate project work so that it can be understood and evaluated by external critics and other audiences.</p>",

The objective of the course is to stimulate students to formulate their own viewpoints by sharpening their critical thinking and enabling a provocative debate into the inquiry of the conceptual nature of urban design. The course concentrates on urban design studios where students will investigate the complex nature of leading urban planning and design trends and identify and evaluate examples of programmatic and experimental urban design on macro, meso and micro levels. The course also includes seminar and analysis sessions as complement to studio project work that will enable the students in learning how to observe, analyze, problematize, discuss and criticize as well how to best design cities.</p><p>After completing the course the students will:</p><ul><li>Comprehend more clearly the relation between theory and practice in urban planning and design and other akin disciplines involved in bridging architecture and planning on micro and meso scales.</li><li>Understand theoretically and practically the complexities of urban design issues in not just designing, but also retrofitting suburban or central city urban areas.</li><li>Discuss and apply lessons from contemporary planning approaches and urban design trends to everyday urbanism problems.</li><li>Express own urban planning and design ideas &amp; results, as well as other viewpoints in a coherent and qualitative way by the way and means of drawings, sketches, discussion and ad-lib/oral manner.</li></ul>",
